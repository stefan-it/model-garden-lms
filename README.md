This repository show-cases language model pretraining with the awesome [TensorFlow Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) library.

The following LMs are current supported:

* [BERT Pretraining](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1423/)
* [Token Dropping for efficient BERT Pretraining](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.262/)
* [Training ELECTRA Augmented with Multi-word Selection](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.219/) (TEAMS)

Additionally, we provide a nice cheatsheet for language model pretraining on shiny TPU VM Pods.
